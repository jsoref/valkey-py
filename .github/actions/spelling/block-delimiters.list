# block-delimiters file...
# - Empty lines are ignored -- you can use them as section delimiters
# - Lines beginning with a `#` are ignored
# - Lines beginning with `\#` let you match blocks where the first character is a `#`
#   -- i.e. the `\` is ignored and the line isn't treated as a comment
#   `\` is not otherwise special
